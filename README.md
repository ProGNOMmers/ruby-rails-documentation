# Updated Ruby and Ruby on Rails versions documentation

I like very much [RailsAPI Ruby and Rails merged documentation](http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.2.6_ruby-v1.9.2/), but the Ruby and Rails documentation versions hosted there are often outdated; so I'll try to provide an updated Ruby/Rails RailsAPI-like merged documentation on the Github pages of this project.
