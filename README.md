# Updated Ruby and Rails documentation

I like very much [RailsAPI Ruby and Rails merged documentation](http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.2.6_ruby-v1.9.2/), but the Ruby and Rails documentations hosted on RailsAPI are often outdated; so I'll try to provide an updated RailsAPI-like Ruby/Rails merged documentation on the Github pages of this project.

## Documentation

### Ruby / Rails versions

At the moment, the documentation is relative to Ruby 2.0.0-p195 and Rails 4.0.0-rc1 .

### Location

You can find the documentation here: http://prognommers.github.io/ruby-rails-documentation/
